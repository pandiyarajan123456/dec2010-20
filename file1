
What is Git?
Git is an open-source, distributed version control system (VCS), which has a remote repository on the server-side and a local repository on the client-side.
This means that the file or code is not present in a central server,but there is a copy of the file stored on the clientâ€™s computer. 
A distributed version control system enables multiple developers to work in parallel with each other without any code conflicts. 
Git enables developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code whenever necessary. 

Git helps both developers and non-tech professionals by keeping track of their project files. It makes it easier 
for multiple individuals to work together, and it plays an extremely significant role in big projects that 
involve large teams.

8.How will you confirm that you have  updated code in your local?
I'll check Git--version command. if i dont see a supported verson of git, 
wil need to either upgrade git or perform a fresh install.

How i'll decide which code should be moved to production if conflict occurs?
There are a few steps that could reduce the steps needed to resolve merge conflicts in Git.

The easiest way to resolve a conflicted file is to open it and make any necessary changes
After editing the file, we can use the git add a command to stage the new merged content
The final step is to create a new commit with the help of the git commit command
Git will create a new merge commit to finalize the merge.
